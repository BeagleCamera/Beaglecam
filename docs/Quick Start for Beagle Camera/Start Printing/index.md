# Start Printing

Camera currently supports printing Gcode files on Camera's Micro SD card through Camera.

At the same time, Camera supports two ways to start printing, through Beagleprint and browser (recommended Google) Web page.[Instructional video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1VRnE4k5Dvg&list=PLSc0XAQ8RossfF7Z-SkeIvYP2vs1O8vf-&index=9){: .btn .btn-green .mr-4 }

_Note: Printing through the printer's Micro SD card will lose the camera remote control and time-lapse video generation functions_

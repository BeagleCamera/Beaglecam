# Choosing a Beagel Camera 

This is a guide to help people in selecting their first Beagel Camera.

# Beagel Camera Models

Cameras have different configurations, and there is no "best" distinction between different configurations, just different. For example, whether the USB port outputs power, the memory size of the Beagle Camera pre-installed Micro SD card, all configurations support "Monitor and Control Your 3D Printer Remotely", "PLUG AND PLAY", "AUTO GENERATE TIME LAPSE VIDEOS".

*Prices are different and may be related to different shipping places, different purchasing platforms, etc.*

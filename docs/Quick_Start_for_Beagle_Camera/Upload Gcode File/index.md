# Upload Gcode File

Camera currently supports uploading Gcode files to the Camera's Micro SD card through the Camera, and starts printing. Printing through the printer's Micro SD card will lose the Camera remote control and time-lapse video generation functions.

At the same time, Camera supports two ways to upload Gcode files, through Beagleprint and browser (recommended Google) Web page.[Instructional video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1VRnE4k5Dvg&list=PLSc0XAQ8RossfF7Z-SkeIvYP2vs1O8vf-&index=9){: .btn .btn-green .mr-4 }

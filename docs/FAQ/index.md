## FAQ

### What is BeagleCamera?
*BeagleCamera is a dual-purpose camera that allows you to remotely monitor and control your 3D printer, such as uploading files, starting printing, monitoring printing progress, etc., while also creating time-lapse videos easily. [Learn more here](/just-the-docs/docs/about)


### How to use BeagleCamera?
*First, connect the BeagleCamear to the power supply and connect the printer, you can use your mobile phone to download and install the Beaglerpint mobile app on GooglePlay or APPstore, then add the BeagleCamera, and then set your printer model, remember to save the settings.

Next, you can log in to the BeagleCamera web page via BeaglePrint (or via a PC
) upload the Gcode file and start printing, and monitor the printing progress through the video stream returned by the camera anytime and anywhere.

For more details on BeagleCamera functions, you can check the [Manual](/just-the-docs/docs/Manual) document below.

### How to log in to BeagleCamera?
You can open the Bealgeprint app on your phone, log in to your account, and monitor the connected printer through the Beagle Camera.
You can also access the BeagleCamera on the PC (within the same LAN as the Camera) using the google browser and enter the ip address to monitor the connected printer.

How to get the camera's ip address, see [Camera Information](/just-the-docs/docs/Manual/Beagleprint%20Device%20Camera%20settings).
How to monitor the same BeagleCamera with multiple mobile phones, see [Share to Your Friends](/just-the-docs/docs/Manual/Beagleprint%20Device%20Camera%20settings).
### How to set up BeagleCamera for the first time?
*Connect the BealgeCamera power cable, and connect the Beagle Camera to the printer.

For more details, you can view the [unboxing video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RWGPZtJCKM&t=87s), and if you encounter problems, you can contact us [for help]().

### How to access the BeagleCamera remotely?
*Beagleprint is a mobile app, you can use your mobile phone to download and install it on GooglePlay or APPstore, and add BeagleCamera to access BeagleCamera remotely.

.How to add BeagleCamera to Beagleprint can check [Camera networking](/just-the-docs/docs/Quick%20Start%20for%20Beagle%20Camera/Camera%20Networking), if you encounter problems, you can contact us [for help]().

### What does the BeagleCamera need?
*To use the BeagleCamera, you need a 3d printer and a mobile phone to install the Bealgeprint app, add the BeagleCamera and use it in the 2.4GHz Wi-Fi network environment.
a BeagleCamera
a printer,
a cell phone,
Internet connection (2.4GHz Wi-Fi)

BeagleCamera comes standard with a Micro USB USB 2.0 cable. If the printer has other serial ports (mini USB / Type C USB), please make sure you have a USB 2.0 cable. Generally, the printer comes with a USB 2.0 cable for serial connection.
The USB cable for serial communication is recommended to choose a USB cable dedicated to data communication (communication is abnormal, it is easy to print abnormally, such as pause, stop)

### What printers does the BeaglerCamera support?
.*BeagleCamera supports many 3D printers, how to confirm whether the BeagleCamera supports the printer you are using, the best way is to check the [BeagleCamera Compatibility List](https://www.3dprinteraccessories.shop/blogs/beagleprint/beagle-camera-is-compatible-with-3d-printers-list) (this is not a complete list, many printers are temporarily not in the list, but it does not affect the printer using BeagleCamera),
Finally, there are some printers that don't have full functionality of the BeagleCamera (for example, some printers may require some setup [eg CR-10 Smart requires a cable to be removed]), in order for the BeageleCamera to connect and use it, so the best way is to add our [Facebook community](https://www.facebook.com/groups/mintion) and find out more with our members.

### How many printers can I run with the Beagle Camera?
*You can only run one printer at a time with BeagleCamera, but you can add multiple BeagleCameras through Beagleprint to run multiple printers [Device](/just-the-docs/docs/Manual/Beagleprint%20Device).

In addition, a BeagleCamera can be connected to multiple printers, as long as it is not at the same time, for example, after printing is completed, it can be connected to other printers for control and printing.

### How do I update the BeagleCamera firmware?
*For BeagleCamear firmware before V1.1.2, you can only update the firmware via Micro SD card. [Learn more here/here](https://www.3dprinteraccessories.shop/blogs/beagleprint/how-to-upgrade-the-firmware-of-mintion-beagle-camera)
For firmware version V1.1.2 and higher, you can update the firmware through Micro SD card, or update the firmware through OTA. [Learn more here/here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFqlzl1x9Yo)


### What size SD card does the BeagleCamera need?
*The Micro SD card in the Beagle Camera basically stores your Gcode files, video files, log files, etc. Therefore, just choose 32GB according to your needs.

Of course, BeagleCamera supports Micro SD card with FAT32 system within 128GB.

### BeagleCamera camera parameters?
*The Beagle camera uses a fixed lens with a focal length of 20cm. If you want to adjust the distance of the camera, you can refer to this article to adjust the lens of the Beagle camera.

The camera is blurry, out of focus, and blurry no matter how you move, you can click full screen and find the SD\HD toggle button [from Beagleprint](just-the-docs/docs/Manual/Beagleprint%20Device%20Video%20window). SD is smoother, HD is high definition.

### How to make BeagleCamera generate time-lapse photography?
Use BeagleCamera's currently compatible slicing software [click here to learn more] to generate a Gcode file, upload it to the BeagleCamera, and start printing. When the printing is complete,
Camera supports two time-lapse photography modes "Clean Timelapse Video" (moving the nozzle to take a snapshot) "Nomal Timelapse Video" (no moving the nozzle to take a snapshot), [Learn more here](/just-the-docs/docs/Manual/Beagleprint%20Device%20Camera%20settings).
Camera enables "Clean Timelapse Video" by default

### The APP prompts that the QR configuration fails, but the Camera voice prompts "Camera success Wi-Fi" (the Wi-Fi indicator is always on)
You can try to search for available Camera devices in the network and add them by adding the "Search in LAN" method in Camera. [Learn more here/here]

If it still can't be solved, you can try [AP configuration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HITww9CnJ0o&list=PLSc0XAQ8Rossckz3ZaQxcMA49GijutVPY&index=6) for network configuration (how to [reset Camera](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1K6h7gDnzENew0jehn5xIJDydq4kbeN5e/view?usp=share_link)).


### How to reset Camera?
There are two ways to reset the Camera, hard reset and soft reset.
Hard reset is by pressing the camera [reset button](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1K6h7gDnzENew0jehn5xIJDydq4kbeN5e/view?usp=share_link), and keep it until you hear the camera playing the voice "Camera is success reset", and wait for it to restart automatically, it will play after the restart is successful "Camera is ready Wi-Fi configuration"[>= V1.1.2]/"Camera is ready AP configuration"[< V1.1.2], it means the camera is reset successfully

Soft reset is done through the [reset button](/just-the-docs/docs/Manual/Beagleprint%20Device%20Camera%20settings), click it, and wait for it to restart automatically, after a successful restart, it will play "Camera is ready Wi-Fi configuration" [>= V1. 1.2]/"Camera is ready AP configuration"[< V1.1.2]/"Camera is success Wi-Fi"[Save Wi-Fi], it means the camera is reset successfully

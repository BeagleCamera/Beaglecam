### Device Management - Delete Camera

You can touch a single device for 3 seconds to trigger a pop-up window to confirm the deletion of the device. After selecting Yes, Camera will release the binding relationship with your login account (but Camera is still connected to the Internet, and the account and password information for connecting to the Internet are still retained). Select "No" to return to the "Device" page.

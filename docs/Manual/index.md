# Manual(Continuous update...)

This guide contains all the the steps to go from opening the package to using the Camera

Please read the guide carefully; there are many details that seem trivial but are included because one or more people got stuck at these points. We as a manufacturer of the product want to make sure that everyone has the best experience possible. If you find something confusing and would like clarification, that likely means someone else in the past or future has found/will also find it difficult. Please reach out and we will gladly update the documentation!

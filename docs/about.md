# About Beagle Camera

The Beagle is an excellent watchdog with a friendly personality; they have reliable guarding and territorial instincts and are highly protective of the family members, making them a good choice for a watchdog.

We hope that our beagle camera becomes a reliable printing guardian like a beagle; We are watching the printing progress from anywhere and finding the temperature abnormal to cause the printing issues to avoid the waste of filament.

### Monitor and Control Your 3D Printer Remotely 

a simple way to monitor and control these printers remotely, and have a look over the printing progress and stop it when something is going wrong.

### PLUG AND PLAY

The Beagle camera is a one-piece design,There are no complicated settings, only three steps to enjoy the camera,Make it Simple

{: .new }

Download and install the Beagleprint app, and configure the Camera to scan the QR code.

* Done

Choose your printer model and start using it.

### Night Version
As a supplement to monitoring, Camera supports Color Night Version (full color effect with weak light source) and Black & White mode, which can better cope with environments such as night time or when the printer is in a dark basement.

### AUTO GENERATE [TIME LAPSE VIDEOS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELQokVHeToM)

This 3d printer camera has embedded the codes in the system to capture the model's image when one layer is finished, automatically backup to the sd card. Create pretty fantastic time-lapse videos without any settings, and then you can download and share them with friends .

Currently, Camera supports two time-lapse photography modes: moving printhead and non-moving printhead.

### Say goodbye to unplugging SD cards

Carrying out the "Make it Simple" concept, Camera can upload and print gcode files through Beagelrpint app or pc web page.

### What printers does the Beagle Camera support

We currently know/test that the Beagle Camera works properly with these printers[these printers](https://www.3dprinteraccessories.shop/blogs/beagleprint/beagle-camera-is-compatible-with-3d-printers-list), a few things to keep in mind here.

* A machine that does not exist in the list does not mean that it cannot be used, but it is not confirmed at present. This list is constantly updated.

* The list says it is compatible, but it can't actually be used. This may be related to the printer firmware version, which is rare. What we know so far is Magician 1.6.6.6.

* Finally, thanks to our many supporters, colleagues for their great contributions to this work.
